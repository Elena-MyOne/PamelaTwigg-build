              <div class="article-item__text text">
                <p>
                  One of the many requirements to becoming a certified coach involves receiving 6 hours of mentor coaching with at least 5 different mentor coaches. How it works: I record a session with one of my clients (after having received permission to do so) and submit an audiotape with analysis to a mentor, who then reviews the recording along with my notes and provides feedback. I hear about what went well and where I need to focus my efforts. In my most recent session, the mentor coach
                  commented on my growth and my ability to pause. Pausing is a powerful tool. It’s one that I admittedly did not tend to employ when I started this journey 15 months ago. I have come to appreciate its strength. One of the best things a coach can do during a session with a client is pause. The space that is created allows the client to reflect, gain (or regain) perspective, possibly gain composure, and solidify a new awareness. It’s also a moment where creativity toward a solution
                  to a challenge can happen.
                </p>
                <p>The next time you find yourself in conversation with a friend, a colleague, a client, your child, or your partner/spouse, and you are noticing that you want to interrupt, rush ahead or jump to conclusions, try pausing. The power of pause can do wonders when you need to quiet that inner voice as well. My tool of the trade is your tip for the day. Just pause.</p>

                <p>
                  On a professional note, I have reached 100 hours of coaching, another milestone in getting certified. I started the Online Immersion into the 10 Archetypes, which when completed in December will bring me one step closer to becoming an Archetypes at Work<sup>TM</sup> practitioner. I have also come back to some earlier ideas about where I would like to focus my work and feel a new sense of energy for combining the Archetypes at WorkTM methodology with coaching for various
                  industries and a retreat or two sprinkled throughout the year. These are longer term goals, so watch this space.
                </p>
                <p>On a personal note, my life seems to revolve around running, running, and running, as well as the occasional soccer game for Anthony, our youngest, who is in 7<sup>th</sup> grade. The half-marathon race is this coming weekend and I’ll be one happy person when I cross the finish line!</p>
