              <p>Have you ever wondered what your life would look like if you quit your job and launched yourself onto a
                new path? Do you feel that you’re not being true to your core values? We all have ambitions, desires,
                and dreams. How many of us act on them? The list of things stopping you from doing so can be long:
                family, responsibility, fear of failure. I know the list well because I let each of these things stand
                in my way.</p>
              <p>Then, after more than 20 years in the corporate world, I made the break. And I’ve never looked back.
                I’ve always known that I’m a nurturing person. The path I chose is one of helping others to achieve
                their dreams.</p>
              <p>If you’re interested in making a change, contact me. I’ll work with you in a safe, trusting
                environment, at a pace you set.</p>

                  <p>What I loved about this model is that it didn’t focus on traits such as "you are an optimist" but
                    it was about behaviors and how we tend to show up in certain situations. And depending on how we
                    show up, that could be perceived as either positive or negative behavior rather than a judgement
                    about the individual. The Archetypes at Work<sup>TM</sup> methodology is uplifting, forward

                    insightful and intentional space that is greatly needed in corporate environments.</p>

                  <p>I found the Archetypes at Work TM assessment very helpful in understanding and assessing my
                    predominate and less predominate behaviors in how I think and act. It is a very useful tool and
                    the assessment was very accessible. When Pamela and I reviewed the assessment report
                    together, she explained in a very constructive and easy way how bringing my off-stage actor
                    (less predominate) more to the stage can help me be more in balance and thus more effective
                    and productive. Through our coaching session, I became more mindful and aware of my
                    behaviors in professional and private situations. Now, even in the moment when I am
                    experiencing these behaviors, I am able to adapt more of a balance in my approach depending
                    on the situation. This really helped create the balance I need to better achieve my goals. Thank
                    you, Pamela and Archetypes at Work TM . Great insights and coaching!</p>

                  <p>What I loved about this model is that it didn’t focus on traits such as "you are an optimist" but
                    it was about behaviors and how we tend to show up in certain situations. And depending on how we
                    show up, that could be perceived as either positive or negative behavior rather than a judgement
                    about the individual. The Archetypes at Work<sup>TM</sup> methodology is uplifting, forward
                    thinking, and working with Pamela to unpack and understand my Archetypal preferences was a great
                    experience.</p>

                  <p>I had the pleasure of working with Pamela on engagement with a global client during a complex
                    merger. I thought Archetypes would be helpful with the newly combined IT executives to learn
                    more about themselves and how they coalesce as a team.  Pamela tailored personal assessments
                    with debriefs followed by a team workshop to reflect on how they are leading through a period
                    of change and stress. This workshop helped the team prioritize strategy and storytelling
