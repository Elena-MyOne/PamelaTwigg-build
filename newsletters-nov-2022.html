                  Something happened recently where I found myself back in school. Not in the classroom, but more on the playground metaphorically speaking, where old patterns of personality wars play out in the form of clicks and side conversations that plant seeds of doubt about the other. At first, I was taken aback by what was happening. Haven’t I moved on from those situations? Haven’t I grown and matured? And then something else happened – I had an ah-ha moment regarding one exchange in
                  particular. I realized that my insecurities about fitting in, of being liked, had played out earlier in conversations that I was having about me feeling like a victim. Even though the awareness did not make me feel proud of my behavior, it did help me to understand what I should do to redirect the current conversations playing out. I picked up the phone and had an open and transparent conversation with the other person. It was hard to do but it turned out to be the right thing.
                  It's hard to look in the mirror and understand what part you are playing in a conflict or a tense situation. It’s hard to see where you might be reverting to old, childish behavior. And at what cost to you? I like thinking that I’m growing, maturing, and shifting old destructive patterns into new rewarding ones. Live and learn.

                  There are many versions available of the model below, but the main takeaway is to understand that we are always functioning on a number of levels, each connecting the next. When we ‘zoom out’ and look at ourselves with the four dimensions in mind, we can see a fuller and richer picture of where we are in life. We can also reflect on where we might be functioning ‘too much’ or ‘too little’ on one level and how we might become more in alignment with all dimensions. One way to
                  know this? When we are in alignment, it feels good. When we’re not, it can feel uncomfortable or restrictive.

I am focused on creating something meaningful for myself and as a result I have so many ideas and areas I am excited to explore. I feel that 2023 will be a pivotal year for Pamela Twigg Coaching.</p>
                <p>On a personal note, I completed the Baltimore half-marathon and was cheered on by my husband, my sons, and our dog! I can’t believe it is now behind me. I can’t say that I have been bitten by the full-marathon bug, but I might be tempted to run another half-marathon at some point. I am looking forward to Thanksgiving. There is so much to be thankful for and I try and remind myself of that each day.</p>
