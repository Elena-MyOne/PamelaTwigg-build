                <p>
                  “Erasing whole horizons of empathy” is a phrase I recently read, and it stuck with me. This was relating to the Second World War and how it was “not only a military conflict but an extraordinary assault on civilians” (Peter Fritzsche). It got me thinking about how necessary and powerful an emotion empathy is and how important it is to express it both personally and professionally. Coaches also have coaches, and I am working on accessing more of my Dreamer archetype with mine.
                  There are many ways I can benefit from allowing my Dreamer to have more of a role in my life. One area is imaging a professional environment where empathy is a given, a strength in leadership. Imagine taking the time to show empathy (not sympathy) at work to a colleague who is stressed about a presentation and is waiting on data from someone else, or a disappointed colleague who just heard someone else got the promotion, or an emotionally drained colleague who is the main
                  caregiver for a sick family member. I truly believe that empathy cascades to others. So, I’m thinking about my own work experiences. Am I curious to know what’s behind a colleague’s frustration or snippy response to a request? Do I take the time to find out? Do I stop and focus on who is in front of me at work? Do I really see them? Expanding horizons of empathy rather than erasing them? Yes, please.

                <p>
                  One of tools that I like to use at the beginning of a coaching contract is the “Wheel of Life Satisfaction.” A client will complete it at the beginning, halfway through, and at the end of our engagement together. It’s a great visual to see where a client may wish to focus based on how they rated an area of their life. I link the three points in time in a radar graph so the client can easily see shifts and development over time. Change occurs where there is intention. The
                  intention drives choices and subsequent actions in the direction of a client’s desired outcome. Sometimes a client may have an area of development in mind before doing this quick assessment, and it’s not uncommon for the wheel of life to reflect a different reality from what they originally had in mind. If you’re interested in working with this tool, reply to this email or send me a text message and I’ll tell you more about it.

                  On a professional note, in January I attended a weeklong coaching training for Olivier Mythodrama, a global leadership development consultancy providing training and one of the founding organizations of Archetypes at Work<sup>TM</sup>. It was an intense and lifechanging experience and I certainly felt inspired and hopeful about the impact of their work. I hope to be working with them as a freelance coach for their inspirational leadership workshops, which they plan to roll out
                  in the US starting this summer.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In March I received my Generative Coach Certification, which is a major milestone for me since making the career switch in 2021. I’m thrilled about this! It’s been a wonderful journey and it’s so rewarding to know that I accomplished this. I also have just finished all the training for Archetypes at Work<sup>TM</sup> and the next step is becoming a guild member this spring. I continue to do assessments, which are always fun, interesting, and educational for me. I held a mini
                  workshop in March for the CIO Leadership Team of a global company, which whetted my appetite for wanting to do more of this work.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I completed a 6-week Positive Intelligence training from Shirzad Chamine, the founder and CEO of Positive Intelligence, Inc. It’s training to build a foundation of mental fitness by strengthening three critical mental muscles to shift the balance of power from your inner Saboteurs (your negative self) to your inner Sage (your positive self). I find that I’m applying the discipline of the “PQ” training to all areas of my life, including when I’m in the waiting room at the
                  doctor’s office! It helps quiet the saboteurs in my head and reduce my “white coat syndrome” anxiety.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I am also working with two wonderfully accomplished women, Heather Carlile and Lynn McCracken, to offer a half-day, in-person workshop for female executives and entrepreneurs in Dallas, on April 21st. We’re incorporating the Archetypes at WorkTM methodology with some of their original material and combining all of this with specifically designed yoga movements. If you are in the Dallas area and are interested in attending, the information for the event is here:

                </p>
                <p>On a personal note, I decided to train for another half marathon in the fall. Some recent interactions have made me pause and reflect more on how I personally measure success. What is the magic combination regarding how all the parts of my life play into success? It’s an interesting puzzle to solve.</p>
