                <p>Professional coaching involves a uniquely collaborative relationship between a coach and an individual or group that aims to enhance participants’ personal and professional growth, improve their performance, and achieve their goals. Where therapy may delve deeply into the past, coaching is focused on the present and future, and involves helping individuals clarify their vision, identify their strengths and weaknesses, set specific and measurable goals, and develop action plans to achieve those goals.</p>
                <p>Professional coaching can benefit individuals at all levels of an organization, from executives to managers to employees, and for individuals in transition who are looking to make a personal or professional change. In working with clients, I employ a variety of tools and techniques to unlock potential, develop self-awareness, gain clarity and focus, and increase confidence.</p>

                  <p>Individual coaching provides an opportunity to brainstorm about a challenge that has recently emerged, where a new way forward is desired. It’s a space where you can think differently in an exploratory and engaging way and often is looking for a new insight to an existing challenge. These work well with clients where a rapport has already been established through longer-term engagements as individual sessions tend to be short notice and ad-hoc in nature. </p>

                  <p>This cutting-edge methodology is based on 10 Archetypes, which are underlying patterns of human behavior. As such they are – often invisibly – “running the show” as we go about our lives. These Archetypes are embedded in our motivations and values. The better we understand these patterns and the more consciously we use them, the more effective we will be. Archetypes at Work™ offers an exciting framework to understand how people act and “what is really going on” – in our life, in our work, and in our deeper self. </p>
                  <p>I am a certified debriefer and Archetypes at WorkTM Guild Member and highly recommend this as a way for clients to assess how they are showing up today vs. how they might need to show up to be more in alignment with their purpose at work and life. It is a positive approach to personal development.
