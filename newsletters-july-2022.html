                  I launch this first newsletter amid mixed emotions – hope, frustration, confusion, anger, sadness. And I am not alone. Like many others, I find myself looking for ways to navigate all the uncertainties and latch onto some solid reasons to hope for a better world, and lately I come up short. My husband sometimes accuses me of being self-centered, saying that “it’s all about Pamela.” In this case, it has to be! In a time of chaos, the only way for me to move forward without being
                  overwhelmed by desperation and pessimism is to focus on myself and how to be more resilient. Tapping into our ability to be imaginative allows us to be expansive, which fuels positivity and creativity. Both are key to being resilient and allowing us to deal with uncertainty. I would love to hear what you’re doing to be resilient. Here are a few suggestions that come to mind:
                </p>
                <p><span class="newsletters-info__bold">Cloud watching</span> – spend 5 minutes looking at what images and shapes roll across the sky</p>
                <p><span class="newsletters-info__bold">Skipping</span> – see what happens to your mood when you sneak in a few skips during your next walk</p>
                <p><span class="newsletters-info__bold">Connecting with new and old friends</span> – create a safe space for connection and calm. Due Quach, founder of Calm Clarity, refers to this as the ‘tend and befriend system’ as part of <i>A Mind-Hacker's Toolkit to Calm Anxiety.</i></p>
                <p><span class="newsletters-info__bold">Listening to music</span> – what role does music play in your life and how can it positively influence your mood? Spend a rainy (or balmy) afternoon listening to music, allowing yourself to roam through your earliest music memories.</p>

              <div class="article-item__text text">
                <p>
                  Coaching is about helping someone, a team or an organization move forward to obtain the desired outcome. There are many tools and methods that can be used in a session to help with the process. They don’t have to be overly complicated and are – quite often – simple. Here’s one that I want to share with you, the Dialogic Orientation Quadrant by Haesun Moon, which is particularly useful for reflection and observation. I often use this myself, questioning where I might be
                  positioned in the quadrant when I’m ‘stuck.’

                <p>Archetypes at Work: <i>Evolving your Story One Character at a Time by Laurence Hillman and Richard Olivier</i></p>
                <p><span class="newsletters-info__bold">Memoirs</span></p>
                <p>I find myself drawn to memoirs lately. No doubt it’s related to the inner work that I’ve been doing over the past 12 months. Here are just a few that I have recently read or are in the pile of books I plan to dive into: <i>In Love: A Memoir of Love and Loss by Amy Bloom</i></p>
                <p>Smalltime: <i>A Story of My Family and the Mob by Russell Shorto</i>; <i>The Secret Life of Dorothy Soames by Justine Cowan</i></p>
                <p>A RIP in Heaven:<i>a Memoir of Murder and Its Aftermath by Jeanine Cummins</i></p>

                <p>
                  June 2022 was a month for celebration. I successfully completed my 12-month coaching certification program with InviteChange [a recognized industry leader in training professional coaches and building organizational cultures where people love to work], the first major milestone in obtaining coaching certification from the ICF, the global organization for coaches and coaching. I also completed the Archetypes at Work™ APR Certified Debriefer training, the first step to becoming
                  an Archetypes at Work™ practitioner and guild member, which I’m really excited about. Archetypes at Work™ offers a comprehensive framework to recognize and understand how people act and “what is really going on” - in individuals, teams, and larger organizational systems. Contact me if you’d like to learn more! On a personal note, I have been training for a half marathon, which I plan to run in the fall with my son, Hector. Yikes!
