                  When I work with a new client, I always start with the basics, regardless of what the client may want to achieve with coaching. Prior to our first session I send some questions. The questions are meant to trigger reflection on core values. By this, I don’t mean society’s values, or their family’s values, but their own. What a life well-lived means to the client. What their favorite activities are. What they are passionate about. Then we look at how satisfied they are in
                  different areas of their lives. How does this compare to where their passion lies, who they are as a person, and how they want to spend their time? Often, there are surprises in areas they thought didn’t need attention. Having this awareness allows us to explore their intentions and the actions required for them to realize their intentions. The realization can be invigorating — confidence in decision-making grows, and a client feels the shift in other areas of life, creating
                  more balance. Knowing who you are, what makes you tick and how you want to live are a good foundation to a successful coaching partnership.

                    Recently I started watching some webinars particularly designed for those clients who have been diagnosed with ADHD. I find that the learning can apply to any of us. It might sound clichéd, but we all have too much going on, we all hate to say no, and we all want to be perfect in everything we do. I mean, who doesn’t, right? And when we’re less than perfect, there are plenty of reminders of how we fall short. The feeling of hustling for appreciation, for attention, for love
                    is something we all recognize at some point in our lives. And it doesn’t have to be that way. One of the many tools that the founder and CEO of <a class="newsletters-info__link text" href="https://ihaveadhd.com/" target="_blank">ihaveadhd.com</a>, certified life coach Kristen Carder, talks about when feeling overwhelmed is SURF. SURF stands for <span class="newsletters-info__bold">Stop</span> (just be quiet and let the emotion be used for unfolding),
                    <span class="newsletters-info__bold">Unfold</span> (create space for the emotion in your body), <span class="newsletters-info__bold">Recede</span>(breathe) and <span class="newsletters-info__bold">Find</span> a way to shift/Figure it out (why did you have the emotion, what are you learning from it). SURF teaches us how to be with emotions by:
                  </p>
                  <p>1. Thinking <img class="article-item__arrow" src="img/blog/icons/arrow_forward.svg" alt="arrow forward" /> Start observing your thoughts (until your brain is empty if need be)</p>
                  <p>2. Feeling <img class="article-item__arrow" src="img/blog/icons/arrow_forward.svg" alt="arrow forward" /> Become grounded (or whatever emotion you love)</p>
                  <p>3. Doing what you want to do (this will only work when you think and feel first)</p>
                  <ol class="article-item__list text" type="a">
                    <li class="text">Constrain <img class="article-item__arrow" src="img/blog/icons/arrow_forward.svg" alt="arrow forward" /> Start cutting things off your list, ruthlessly</li>
                    <li class="text">Decide <img class="article-item__arrow" src="img/blog/icons/arrow_forward.svg" alt="arrow forward" /> What do you want to do</li>
                    <li class="text">Schedule <img class="article-item__arrow" src="img/blog/icons/arrow_forward.svg" alt="arrow forward" /> Schedule the activity by looking at your schedule, does it make sense based on your diary</li>
                    <li class="text">Execute <img class="article-item__arrow" src="img/blog/icons/arrow_forward.svg" alt="arrow forward" /> Do it, make sure you are taking care of yourself and if you feel you can’t do it, go back to SURF on that emotion</li>

                  The past few months have been very busy here in the Koch-Shorto-Twigg household! On a professional note, I have been growing my business and have signed on several new clients, for which I am very excited and grateful. I have been exploring and sharpening my skills as an Archetypes at Work<sup>TM</sup> debriefer. In October I will be starting an intensive deep-dive weekly training on all 10 archetypes, with the intent of becoming a practitioner and guild member of the
                  Archetypes at Work<sup>TM</sup> organization. The responses of those who have taken the assessment and had a debrief session with me have been positive to-date. I will be giving a lunchtime webinar at the local Chamber of Commerce on time management on September 15<sup>th</sup>. On a personal note, I spent three wonderful weeks in Europe in August: a week in London, a week with most of our children and their partners in the French Cahors region and a week in Amsterdam (my
                  second home, so to say). The main purpose of the Amsterdam portion of the trip was the marriage of our oldest son. It was magical!
